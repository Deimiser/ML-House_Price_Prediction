# ML-House_Price_Prediction
a simple house price prediction program using Linear Regression

this simple program can be used for house price prediction using linear regression in the program we are using a small dataset of 2*5 2 rows and 5 columns 
In the model we are tring to predict the price of the house depending on the area
We are implementing simple Linear regression in which the house price is our dependent variable and the Area of the house (in sq.ft.) is our dependent variable.
We are providing a small dataset to train the model so the model can accodingly predict the price of the house with areas outside the dataset
